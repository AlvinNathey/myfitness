# MyFitness

MyFitness is a Flutter-based fitness tracking application designed to help users manage their fitness activities, track their workouts, and stay motivated. The app leverages Firebase for authentication and data storage, providing a seamless user experience.

## Screenshots

### Login Screen
![Login Screen](screenshots/login.png)
After running the Flutter app, this is the first page users are introduced to, where they can input their email and password to access the app. New users can click on "Don't have an account? Sign up here," leading them to the **Sign-Up** page.

### Sign-Up Screen
![Sign-Up Screen](screenshots/signup.png)
Here, new users will be prompted to enter their details. If any incorrect information is provided, users will receive an error notification. Upon successful sign-up, users will be redirected back to the login page.

### Home Screen
![Home Screen](screenshots/homepreview1.png)
Once logged in, users are taken to the Home page. Their name will be displayed in the top right corner, and they can select either cardio or weight lifting options.

#### Cardio Options

The cardio option features six variants, as shown here.

#### Weight Lifting Options

The weight lifting option includes four variants.

### Recording Activity
When a user decides to record their activity by clicking on their chosen exercise (e.g., Outdoor Running), they will be prompted to enter the duration of their workout in minutes and the calories burned.

![Recording Data Prompt](screenshots/recording_data1.png)
For example, the user can input that they exercised for 20 minutes and burned 211 calories, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Recording Data Input](screenshots/recording_data2.png)

Once the user clicks "Record," their data will be saved to Firebase. The Home page will reload, capturing the most recent activity:

![Recent Activity](screenshots/recording_data3.png)
The Recent Activity section can only display a maximum of four activities, showcasing the most recent entries. All previously recorded activities can be accessed under the **Records** tab.

### Records Tab
![Records Tab](screenshots/records.png)
Upon clicking an activity, users will have the option to view, edit, or delete their details. For demonstration, we will edit our most recent activity from 20 minutes and 211 calories to 24 minutes and 222 calories:

![Editing Activity](screenshots/records_2.png)
After editing, the updated details will be shown:

![Updated Activity](screenshots/record_3.png)
The time of the activity will also be updated automatically based on when the user makes changes.

### Stats Page
The **Stats** page provides a summary of total calories burned in a day. If a user manages to burn more than 200 calories, they will receive a congratulatory message:

![Stats Summary](screenshots/stats1.png)
When users click on a day, they will see all activities performed that day along with the calories burned for each:

![Daily Activities](screenshots/stats2.png)
For reference, we can compare this with the Records tab, which displays the same data:

![Reference Data](screenshots/records_4.png)

### Profile Section
The **Profile** section displays the details users entered during sign-up:

![Profile Section](screenshots/profile1.png)
When entering their date of birth, the app calculates the current age, eliminating the need for manual updates. Users can also enter their height and weight, which are editable:

![Edit Profile](screenshots/profile2.png)
Since users may want to change their height or weight over time, these options remain flexible. The page also includes a logout button that redirects users back to the login screen:
